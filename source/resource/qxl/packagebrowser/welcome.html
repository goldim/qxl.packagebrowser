  <h1>Welcome to the Package Browser</h1>
  <p>qooxdoo's "plugin architecture" is called <span style="font-weight: bold">
    qooxdoo package system</span> and has the following features:
    <ul>
    <li>
      It allows to extend one's own application with useful functionality such
      as file uploads, dialog widgets, vector graphics, themes, and much more.
    </li>
    <li>
      It hosts components that have previously shipped with the framework, such as
      the API viewer or the playground. You can also distribute whole qooxdoo
      applications this way.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>To learn how to install the packages or to publish your own qooxdoo library
    as a package, please consult the <span style="font-weight: bold">documentation</span>
    on <a href="javascript:void(window.open('/docs/#/cli/packages'))">the qooxdoo package system</a>.</p>
  <p>This application serves to discover and maintain the available qooxdoo packages.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Please <span style="font-weight: bold">browse the packages</span> by owner
      and repository on the left side or search the packages using the filter.
      The state of the filter and of the selection in the list are persisted in
      the URL, so you can link to the application state via its URL.
    </li>
    <li>
      Check out the <span style="font-weight: bold">live
      demos</span> of <a href="javascript:void(top.location.href='/#filter~demos')">
      all packages that contain a compilable application</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      This web app can also be used to control the quality of the packages. It
      displays  <a href="javascript:void(top.location.href='/#filter~problems')">
      warnings and errors</a> that were logged during the compilation. In a future
      version, linting and test results will also be displayed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Please note that the package data is generally regenerated every 24 hours,
      so you will see new packages and new releases after a certain delay. To
      browse the latest and greatest versions of the packages, clone the
      <a href="javascript:void(window.open('https://github.com/qooxdoo/qxl.packageviewer'))">
        qooxdoo/qxl.packageviewer repo</a>
      and (re)build it with  <pre>qx serve --clean</pre>.
  </ul>
